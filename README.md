# Sound Engineering DUTh
Assignments from 6th Semester course in Sound Engineering at ECE DUTh. The repo contains 3 projects.  
# First Project  
The first project covers the following topics:  
- decomposing the sound wave into frames and reconstructing the initial sound
- finding the energy of the sound wave
- denoising based on the energy of its frame
- denoising with spectral subtraction  
# Second Project
The second project covers the topics related to CELP:  
- computing LPC coefficients
- finding the error of linear prediction
- computing the dictionary used in CELP
- audio encoding & decoding using CELP with different dictionary sizes  
# Third Project
The third project covers different sound effects:
- tube distortion effect
- rotary speakers
- schroeder reverberator
